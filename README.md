JavaAlgorithms
==============

This is a repo for a class project I have involving algorithms in Java.

I need to make a class for each of the following types of sorting algorithms:

	A. Quick Sort
	B. Selection Sort
	C. Insertion Sort
	D. Merge Sort
	E. Bucket Sort
	F. Radix Sort

I then need to pipe the output to a text file.
