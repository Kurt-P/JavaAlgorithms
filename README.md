JavaAlgorithms
==============

This is a repo for a class project I have involving algorithms in Java.

I need to make a class for each of the following types of sorting algorithms:

	A. Quick Sort
	B. Selection Sort
	C. Insertion Sort
	D. Merge Sort
	E. Bucket Sort
	F. Radix Sort

I am making the methods for the classes static, so that you don't need to 
instantiate an instance of the class to use the sorting methods. Simular 
to how the Math library works.
	
I then need to pipe the output to a text file.
